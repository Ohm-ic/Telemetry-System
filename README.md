# MQTT Sensor Data Project

## Overview

This project implements a robust IoT system that collects sensor data from an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and synchronizes time with an NTP server using a DS3231 RTC module. The collected data is published to an MQTT topic, ensuring that the data is accurately timestamped after synchronization. This setup is ideal for applications in home automation, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration**: 
  - Collects real-time data from the MPU6050 for acceleration and gyroscopic movements.
  - Utilizes the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for accurate distance measurements.
  
- **Time Synchronization**: 
  - Synchronizes time with an NTP server using the DS3231 RTC module, ensuring accurate timestamps for sensor readings.

- **MQTT Communication**: 
  - Publishes sensor data to a specified MQTT topic, allowing for easy integration with other IoT devices and platforms.

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Implements checks for sensor failures and connection issues to provide robust operation.

- **Data Logging**: 
  - Optionally logs data locally for further analysis or debugging.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mqtt-sensor-data.git
   cd mqtt-sensor-data

Install required libraries:
Ensure you have the ESP-IDF framework installed. You may need to install specific libraries for MQTT, I2C, and sensor handling:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure your Wi-Fi credentials:
Modify the WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD in the code to connect to your network.
Install additional dependencies:
Depending on your setup, you might need to install additional libraries for MQTT and sensor communication.
Usage
Build the project:
Use the ESP-IDF build system to compile the project:
bash
idf.py build

Flash the firmware to your ESP32 device:
Connect your ESP32 device to your computer and run:
bash
idf.py -p (YOUR_PORT) flash

Monitor the output:
Use the following command to view logs and debug information:
bash
idf.py -p (YOUR_PORT) monitor

Access MQTT Data:
Use an MQTT client (like MQTT.fx or Mosquitto) to subscribe to the topic you configured in your code to view incoming data.
Configuration
Wi-Fi Configuration
Update the following lines in your code with your Wi-Fi credentials:
c
#define WIFI_SSID "Your_SSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "Your_Password"

MQTT Broker Configuration
Set the MQTT broker URL in your configuration:
c
#define CONFIG_BROKER_URL "mqtt://yourbroker.com"
#define CONFIG_MQTT_TOPIC "sensor/data"

Sensor Pin Configuration
Ensure that the GPIO pins for your sensors are correctly set:
c
#define TRIGGER_GPIO 18 // GPIO pin for ultrasonic trigger
#define ECHO_GPIO 19    // GPIO pin for ultrasonic echo
#define MPU6050_ADDRESS 0x68 // I2C address for MPU6050

NTP Server Configuration
Specify the NTP server address if needed:
c
#define NTP_SERVER "pool.ntp.org"

Code Structure
The project consists of several key components:
main.c: The main application file where initialization and loop logic occur.
sensors/: Directory containing code related to sensor initialization and data retrieval.
mqtt/: Directory containing MQTT-related functions including connection handling and publishing messages.
utils/: Utility functions such as time synchronization and logging.
